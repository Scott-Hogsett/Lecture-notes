## 21st of November

### Usability testing
- fixation, the thing that you are drawn to look. 
- moving from fixation to fixation.
- which words to use, use words that the reader will look at and understand, what language will they understand better. this is not just dumbing it down, it's opening up.

#### Typography
- return path reading, the user will reread to make sure that they understand what they've read. 
- don't force readers to work your way. work theirs, make changes to the way that the user will use the product. 
- 

### Usability testing 
- if you want a great product you have to test 
- testing one user is better than testing none 
- testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 near the end. 
- test with 5 users, you will most likely find the problems with product with 5 people. 
- make sure that the test user is close to the characteristics of the target audience.
- quicktime can be used to record users screen and see how they go through the website.
- there will often be an observer will just watch and take notes, the phisilitator will be there to relax the particpant and give them tasks to do.

### What do you test?
- usability test other websites to see the advantages and disadvantages of a competitors product and then learn from their mistakes and there positives.
- give them tasks to do 3 or 4 but don't give them help, this can be done via scenario but don't help them at all.
- prepare pre-test and post-test interview questions for background information and then also product satisfaction.

##### usability run through.
- prepare pre and post questions, prepare tasks for the user. 
- ask pre test questions.
- Give participant written instructuions for first task. record start/ end time and observations.
- ask your post test questions.
- prepare report. 
- ask both positive and negative questions to get their real opinion

### when do you test it?
- it is better to test it at the beginning.
- think aloud protocol, learning and listening to your users thoughts. you want them to talk about it while they do it so they're not doing it from memory.

##### Usability metrics
- efficiency
- effectiveness
- satisfaction
