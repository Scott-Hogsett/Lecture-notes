### Tying it together 

### Principles of user interfaces
- Formating content, structure the content so that users can see it properly. 
- Touch control, apple user interface guidlines, Buttons should be able to interact with all of the buttons.
- Jakob's Law, Users spend their time on other sites. this means users prefer your site to work the same as other apps.
- Fit's law, the time to aquire a target is a funtion of the distance to and size of the target. 
- law of pragnanz, People will perceive and interpret ambigious or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the last cognitive effort of us. 
- Think about the contrast between colour of text and the background, as well as illustrations and icons. 
- kerning, spacing and line height is something to consider when designing.
- images have to be in the perfect aspect ratio.
- Hick's Law the time to aquire a target is a fuction of the distance to and size, 
- Alignment, make sure users can digest the information before putting the call to action. the design of everyday things
- finger width in pixels is 44 to 57 pixels. 72 pixel touch target is the ideal size, it fits snugly inside.
- Von Restoroff effect, the isolation effect, predicts that when multiple simialar object are present.

### Colour
- Colour is a critical part of app design, add the colour pallete into the tumblr blog.

### App critique feedback

- Consistency is key, and for app design repition and constant colours and design patterns is the best option for design. 
- Label icons so users can understand what they do. 
- Make sure the users knows what to do and make sure that it is properly labeled. 
- I need to work on the type choices and work on the weight of the text that i choose so there is more of a distiguishable hierarchy.
