### Notes
- A designer is concerned with execution, while an art director is concerned with the strategy behind that execution
- Art direction happens before design. the art siredt

- a fornt end developer then codes the wesite.
- Emelement collages, style tiles
- these can be very helpful for the client to see the direction of the project.
