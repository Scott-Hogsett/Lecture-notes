Crazy 8′s

We decided that it would be a good idea to do crazy 8's as a group 

1. App that allows users to choose what topics/categories they receive stories on.
2. Kids NEWS website/app that uses language that they can understand and relate to, tailor designed for them. 
3. Student specific NEWS that includes stories that effect them or that interest them.
4. App that combines Multiple newspapers articles on one story so that the user can receive multiple points of view on one story. 
5. Inpired by Netflix, the user picks NEWS articles that interest them then the app takes these and directs stories that will most likely interest the user. 
6. Combine stories from Newspapers, Tabloids and other digital media so users can get a good mix of stories. 
7. App that combines multiple journalists to combine on a story to get multiple points of view
8. A chatroom for people to chat about a story they have seen on the news, each story will have a chatroom that they can jump into to keep the conversation going. Inpiration from Reddit threads.
