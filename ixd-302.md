## Ideas for Digital product 

### Pub Crawl app

#### Feature and overview of the app.
- My first idea for a Digital product is an app in which people can go on to the app and look at the different pubs across belfast and for it to provide the location, prices of drinks and if there is a beer garden in the bar. 
- The name 'pub crawl' is a feature that users can use to plan their pub crawl, they could personalise a route that they would take and check of as they work their way through the different pubs.
- It would include a rating system that people could provide feedback on the pub they visited, this could be helpful to both other customers and the pubs themselves.

#### Target audience 
- I think the target audience is 18 to mid 20s, this is because I think that students would be more likely to download the app and be up for trying out different pubs whereas people older than students are more likely to stick to one pub. although it would be interesting to research this further.

#### Visual and presentation
- When it comes to the design I think that a fun flat design style with bright colours would catch the eye of students.
- Flat design is a very popular style at the moment, it is used on a lot of clothes websites as well as on social media which is also targeted at students.

#### Pros and Cons 
- pro, there will be a large pool of potential users in Belfast with the universities and colleges in the city. 
- pro, there are numerous bars in belfast so that all of the users can find something that they like.
- Con, it could be difficult to convince bars to give information about the bar especially if the rating system is unkind to them. 
- Con, it could take a lot of time researching the layout of belfast and where the bars are in relation to each other and working out the best route to each one. 

#### Profit
- Students are less likely to want to pay for an app, they want something they can download fast before a night out.
- I think that there is two options, one being the app is free but there are advertisements, this could be difficult to aquire companies to invest in adds on an drinking app and ads can be fustrating to deal with.
- another option is the app is free but to access features such as planning the pub crawl and having the route displayed costs money, this would require people to warm up to the app and then they could buy the extra feature.
