## Ideas for Digital product 

### Pub Crawl app

#### Feature and overview of the app.
- My first idea for a Digital product is an interactive app in which people can go on to the app and look at the different pubs across belfast and for it to provide the location, prices of drinks and if there is a beer garden of each bar. 
- the name 'pub crawl' is a feature that users could use to plan their pub crawl, they could personalise a route that they would take and check of as they move through the different pubs,
- I also think that it would be cool if there was a reating system that people could provide feedback on the pub they visited, this could be helpful to both other customers and the pub themselves.

#### Target audience 
- I think the target audience is 18 to mid 20s, this is because I think that students would be more likely to download the app and trying out different pubs whereas people older than students are more likely to stick to one pub. although it would be interesting to research this further.

#### Visual and presentation
- when it comes to the design I think that a fun flat design style with bright colours that would interest students.
- flat design is a very popular style at the moment, it is used on a lot of clothes websites as well as on social media.
